          My first lines of code were written over a decade ago. Professionally,
          my career started {new Date().getFullYear() - 2018} years ago. I am
          currently a Fullstack Developer at Ivy.ai, where I primarily work with
          TypeScript.

          Throughout my time with code, I have participated in many
          projectsâ€”mostly related to the web, but not exclusively. You can read
          more about my career and other personal projects below.
